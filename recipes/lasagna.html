            <h2> The Best Classic Lasagna Recipe</h2>
            <p>
                <i>The perfect lasagna recipe made with parmesan ricotta cheese filling, melted mozzarella cheese, lasagna noodles, and a robust tomato meat sauce. It is the best lasagna recipe!</i>

                <strong>This is one recipe my husband begs me to make. He is obsessed with this lasagna and if he is stressed or overwhelmed with work, this is what I make him. It is the perfect comfort food meal! Thereâ€™s something so amazing about homemade, made-from-scratch lasagna.  Whenever he orders beef lasagna at a restaurant, he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm, comforting dinner and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).</strong>
